# Cookie Policy

As stated in our Privacy Policy, a cookie is a piece of data contained in a very small text file that is stored in your browser or elsewhere on your hard drive. Cookies allow Luminova to identify your device as you navigate our website or your account. This makes navigating and interacting with our website or your account more efficient, easy and meaningful for you.

By themselves, cookies do not identify you specifically. Rather, they recognize your web browser. So, unless you identify yourself specifically to Luminova, like signing into your account, we won’t know who you are just because you visited our website.

### Do not track

Some browsers allow a “do not track” (DNT) setting that requests that a web application disable its tracking of an individual user. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser will send a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug-in providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. To set up DNT, you can visit the [All About DNT](https://allaboutdnt.com/) page. If you do choose to set up DNT, please note that it could impact the functionality of our website.

### Opting out of advertising cookies

Third-party advertising partners who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) are listed at the sites below. These sites provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from those participating companies, which you can access at:

### Blocking and disabling cookies and similar technologies

Wherever you're located you may also set your browser to block cookies and similar technologies, but this action may block our essential cookies and prevent our website from functioning properly, and you may not be able to fully utilize all its features and services. You should also be aware that you may also lose some saved information (e.g., saved login details, site preferences) if you block cookies on your browser. Different browsers make different controls available to you. Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the cookie from your browser, you will need to do this yourself from within your browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
